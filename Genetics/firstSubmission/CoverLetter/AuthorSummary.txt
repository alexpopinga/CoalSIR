The field of ‘phylodynamics’, a marriage of phylogenetics with epidemic and population dynamics, has recently produced several models for inferring epidemiological parameters from genetic sequence data.  One of these models is the coalescent SIR.  The authors implement and extend a coalescent SIR model for full Bayesian inference from time-stamped sequence data, also adding the ability to handle demographic stochasticity in epidemic trajectories.  They demonstrate the superiority of the stochastic coalescent SIR model over its deterministic variant and compare its performance with a recently published birth-death-sampling model.  The latter proves to be more computationally efficient and less bias- and error-prone.
