Simulated.zip contains the xml files used in the BEAST 2 analyses on simulated, fixed trees.  The directories MASTER, stochCoal, and deterCoal describe XMLs containing true stochastic SIR (simulated by MASTER), stochastic coalescent, and deterministic coalescent trees.  Within each of directories are directories labelled by inference methods stochastic coalescent SIR ("stochSIR"), deterministic coalescent SIR ("deterSIR"), and BDSIR ("BDSIR").

There are also three divisions within the MASTER directory for trees simulated by the high 
R_0 value (2.50), mid R_0 value (1.50), and low R_0 value (1.10), as discussed in 
"Bayesian epidemic inference with the coalescent" (Popinga et al., 2014).

BDSIR_HIV1.zip contains the XMLs used by Kuhnert et al., 2014 to analyze HIV-1 subtype B sequence data using BDSIR.  CoalescentSIR_HIV1.zip contains all XMLs used for coalescent SIR analyses on the same data.
